Laptop Price Prediction Machine Learning Module
Overview
This machine learning module aims to predict the price of laptops based on their specifications. The module utilizes a dataset containing over 1,300 laptop listings, making it suitable for analysis and modeling. However, before employing the dataset for training models, it's essential to perform data cleaning and preprocessing to handle inconsistencies and missing values.

Dataset
The dataset consists of laptop listings with various attributes such as brand, model, screen size, processor type, RAM, storage capacity, operating system, and price. The dataset is reasonably sized, providing enough samples for training and testing machine learning models effectively.
